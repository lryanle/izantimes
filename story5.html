  <div id="topic">
  <span>The old director of the Moore high school band, Mark Mueller, used to teach the current WHAP teacher, Mr.
    Mehrabian. As a band sophomore, Mehrabian used to use dot books during to record the sets for their marching shows.
    The nex day, Mr. Mehrabian accidentally left his dot book in his cargo shorts, and to his horror, a dot book check
    was occurring after another band member forgot theirs. At the time, dot book checks were rare, so Mr. Mehrabian new
    he was in for a beating. When he was up in line for the check, Highland East Jr. High band director, Ms. Taylor,
    didn't show any kindness or sympathy to him. When Mr. Mueller asked for his dot book on the other hand, Mr.
    Mehrabian explained his situation. Knowing Mr. Mehrabian was a responsible guy, Mr. Mueller showed sympathy towards
    him because he wasn't the type of person to call a kid out in front of their peers.<br>
